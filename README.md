# Introduce
JET is a RL method that trains models to **proactively terminate unnecessary thinking**. JET operates through two key components. 

- it additionally performs trajectory truncation during RL rollout, exposing the model to reasoning paths of varying lengths while keeping them aligned with the modelâ€™s natural generation. 
- introduce a quality-controlled length reward to better guide the model toward efficiency. This reward identifies the shortest correct trajectory in each reasoning group as a baseline and assigns length penalties to longer correct trajectories.

# Requirements
This repository contains the codebase based on [VeRL](https://github.com/volcengine/verl) and [Lighteval](https://github.com/huggingface/lighteval) .
We use two separate conda environments for each stage:
 
```bash
#create the running environment

#JET training env
conda env create -f environment/verl_env.yaml
conda activate verl_env

#eval env
conda env create -f environment/lighteval_env.yaml
conda activate lighteval_env
````

# QuickStart

```bash
# step1: Training
conda activate verl_env
cd Just-Enough-Think/EasyR1/examples
bash run.sh

# step2: Merge the checkpoint
conda activate verl_env
cd Just-Enough-Think/EasyR1/
python scripts/model_merger.py --local_dir your_ckp_path/global_step_70/actor

#step3: eval
conda activate lighteval_env
cd Just-Enough-Think
bash eval/eval.sh
````

# Datasets
We provide training and test datasets for JET.
- Training data: data/training/training_cleaned.json
- Test data path: data/test

# Acknowledgement
We thank the [VeRL](https://github.com/volcengine/verl) for providing the awaresome open-source RL infrastructure.

# Models
We will release our models soon [ðŸ¤—HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/).
